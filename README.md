# blogtato

A CLI RSS/Atom feed reader inspired by Taskwarrior.

![demo](demo/demo.gif)

## Features

- Subscribe to RSS and Atom feeds
- Simple query language for filtering by feed, read status, and date, with
  grouping and export
- Git-based sync across machines with conflict-free merge
  ([why git?](#design-philosophy))
- No accounts, no servers, no continuous network dependency
- Mark content as read
- Designed to be distraction free, minimalistic and work out of the box

## Install

```bash
cargo install blogtato
```

### Git sync

`git` based synchronization is entire optional. `blogtato` can work entirely
offline on a single device.

To set up git synchronization, create a private repo on your git host, then:

```bash
# On your first machine
blog clone user/repo

# From now on, sync fetches feeds and pushes/pulls from the remote
# with no remote repository, `blog sync` just pulls the latest posts from
# all feeds
blog sync
```

On your device(s), run the same `blog clone` to pull down your feeds and posts.

Don't worry about setting git sync up if you are just trying `blogtato` out:
you can run `blog clone user/repo` later and your existing feeds will be merged
with the remote automatically.

### Quick start

Once you set up your `git`-based sync, or if you decided to skip it, subscribe
to your favorite feeds using `blog feed add`:

```bash
blog feed add https://michael.stapelberg.ch
blog feed add https://www.justinmklam.com
```

You can import your subscriptions from other RSS readers

and others) using an OPML file:

```bash
blog feed import feeds.opml
```

Fetch and list latest posts:

```bash
blog sync
blog
```

Read whatever you found interesting by referring to its shorthand

```bash
blog df read
```

You can subscribe to `blogtato` releases to know when new features or fixes are
available:

```bash
blog feed add https://github.com/kantord/blogtato/releases.atom
```

## Usage examples

```bash
# Subscribe to a feed
blog feed add https://news.ycombinator.com/rss

# Fetch new posts and sync with git remote
blog sync

# Show posts (defaults to unread posts from the last 3 months, grouped by week)
blog

# Group by date, week, or feed
blog /d
blog /w
blog /f

# Combine groupings
blog /d /f

# Filter by feed shorthand
blog @hn

# Filter by read status
blog .unread
blog .read
blog .all

# Filter by date
blog 1w..
blog 3m..1m
blog /d 2w..1w

# Combine filters - list unread posts form HackerNews grouped by date
blog @hn .unread /d

# Open a post in the default browser
blog abc open

# Print a post URL (useful with CLI browsers)
blog abc read
w3m $(blog abc read)

# Mark a post as unread
blog abc unread

# Export matching posts as JSONL
blog .all export
blog @myblog export
blog 1w.. export

# List subscriptions
blog feed ls

# Remove a feed
blog feed rm https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
blog feed rm @hn
```

## Design philosophy

I built `blogtato` around the idea of subscription detox and simplicity. I just
wanted to use a simple and RSS reader that is not distracting, but can be
synced between different devices seamlessly without having to set up another
user account and paying another monthly subscription fee.

`blogtato` uses a simple database that stores data in JSONL files and syncs
them using `git`. From a performance standpoint, this is admittedly
sub-optimal, and an quite esoteric design. At the same time, if you are
comfortable with CLI tools you likely have access to a remote `git` host such
as GitHub, GitLab or a Forgejo instance: and that's all `blogtato` needs to be
able to keep data up to date on all of your devices. From a user perspective,
this just works with effectively zero configuration.

`blogtato`'s database uses a conflict-free design: even if you have diverging
changes between different devices, you will never have to manually resolve
conflicts. You can forget about `git` being there.

Network operations are always initiated by the user. There is no need for a
continuously running server. And all operations that don't strictly need
network access work offline.

It is my goal to keep the feature-set and the complexity of this project down,
so that it can be maintained with minimal effort and can be considered to be
"done".

## Optional configuration

**`blogtato` is designed to work out of the box without any configuration.**
Most users should never need to change any settings. Nevertheless, a few things
can be configured, when the nature of the synchronized database calls for
measures to protect data consistency, or in other cases where taking advantage
of the synced database for storing the configuration would be convenient.

Configuration is stored in the same git-based database as your feeds and posts,
so settings automatically sync across all your devices.

### Custom store location

By default, `blogtato` stores data in the platform-specific data directory:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/blogtato/stores/default`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/blogtato/stores/default` (typically
  `~/.local/share/blogtato/stores/default`)

You can override this location by setting `RSS_STORE` env:

```bash
export RSS_STORE=/path/to/another/store
```

### Custom default query

By default, `blog` with no arguments shows unread posts from the last 3 months
grouped by week. You can change this:

```bash
# Show posts from the past 3 months grouped by date instead
blog config set default_query '.all /d 3m..'

# Show unread posts from the last week
blog config set default_query '.unread 1w..'

# Reset to built-in default
blog config unset default_query
```

### Ingest filter

You can configure a [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) expression that
transforms posts during `blog sync`, before they are stored. This lets you
filter out unwanted content or rewrite fields. The expression receives an array
of post objects and must return an array.

`blogtato` calls [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) as an external process. It
is not bundled with `blogtato`

- it is an optional runtime dependency, only needed if you configure an
  `ingest_filter`. When no filter is set, all posts are stored as-is.

`jq` was chosen over arbitrary shell scripting because feed data is structured
JSON, which is difficult to manipulate correctly with most other shell tools,
so users would otherwise just create shell script files that are a boilerplate
wrapper over `jq`. `jq` is the standard tool for this purpose that most CLI
users already have installed and are familiar with.

Also, calling an arbitrary binary/script file would be a runtime dependency
that does not automatically sync to other machines, so one could easily create
runtime errors or load inconsistent data in the database. Storing a `jq`
expression in the synced database means it automatically carries over to all
your devices.

```bash
# Filter out sponsored posts
blog config set ingest_filter '[.[] | select(.title | startswith("[Sponsored]") or contains("Partner Content") | not)]'

# Strip tracking parameters from links
blog config set ingest_filter '[.[] | .link |= sub("\\?utm.*"; "")]'

# Combine both: filter sponsored posts and strip tracking parameters
blog config set ingest_filter '[.[] | select(.title | startswith("[Sponsored]") or contains("Partner Content") | not) | .link |= sub("\\?utm.*"; "")]'

# Remove the filter
blog config unset ingest_filter
```

Each post object has these fields: `title`, `date`, `link`, `raw_id`, `feed`.

## Naming

The naming is meant to symbolize simplicity and pragmatic silliness: I just
mashed the word "blog" together with the first word I could think of: potato.

## Comparison with alternatives

`blogtato` is relatively new and there are several good, and more mature
alternatives. This section attempts to summarize how they differ from
`blogtato` and why some users might still prefer to use `blogtato` instead.

### [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/)

Newsboat is a very mature TUI RSS client with a wide range of features that
`blogtato` does *not* have. Just like `blogtato`, it supports local-only
workflows.

It can also act as a client to remote servers, so if you are ok with having to
self-host a server or signing up to a hosted server, then `blogtato`'s `git`
sync feature is not a relevant differentiator for you.

Another reason why `blogtato` might be relevant to you is that it has a
Taskwarrior-like interface that is even more minimalistic than Newsboat.

### [Newsraft](https://codeberg.org/newsraft/newsraft)

Newsraft is a more minimalistic alternative to Newsboat. The
[Newsboat](#newsboat) breakdown mostly applies.

### [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/), [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) & [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/)

These are mature, self-hostable web-based RSS readers/aggregators. What
`blogtato` offers in comparison is a minimalistic CLI interface and effectively
zero-setup sync between different machines using `git`, without the need for an
additional, continuously running server.

### [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/)

These are full-featured web-based services. If you are a heavy RSS-user and
like the user interfaces and features they offer (such as GUI apps for iOS and
Android, content recommendations) you will likely prefer one of these options.

You could find `blogtato` interesting if you'd prefer a more minimalistic,
distraction-free CLI interface and do not need their advanced features.
